# **App Name**: Habitual

## Core Features:

- Habit Creation: Allow users to create new habits with details such as name, color, icon, group, numeric objective, and frequency.
- Habit Group Management: Enable users to create, edit, and delete habit groups (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
- Habit Completion Tracking: Implement logic to track habit completion, including a check button for simple habits and a segmented progress indicator for counting habits.
- "Functional Day" Logic: Implement the "Functional Day" rule where the day changes at 3:00 AM instead of midnight.
- Persistent Local Storage: Utilize efficient local storage to automatically save habit data, ensuring minimal storage usage while maintaining history.
- Daily Motivational Quote: Display a unique motivational quote each "Functional Day," changing only after 3:00 AM and not allowing manual refresh for a new quote on the same day.
- Haptic Feedback and Celebratory Animation: Provide haptic feedback upon habit completion and a micro-particle (confetti) animation when a habit reaches 100% completion.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pastel blue (#A0D2EB) to create a calming and consistent user experience. This blue evokes a sense of tranquility and reliability.
- Background color: Lightest pastel blue (#EBF4FA, approximately 20% saturation), closely related to the primary color. This maintains visual consistency while ensuring sufficient contrast.
- Accent color: Pastel purple (#BCA0EB, analogous to the primary color) offers a different, engaging touch. The contrast in saturation and brightness against the primary helps important interactive elements stand out without disrupting overall consistency.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) provides a modern yet warm feel suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use emojis for habit icons to provide visual cues.
- Employ a minimalist layout with bubble-style, rounded-edge cards to represent habits and groups.
- Use subtle animations such as micro-particles (confetti) upon habit completion for user feedback.
